        Boti Falls is located just 17km North-east of Koforidua, the eastern regional capital. For those interested in how soon it takes to get there, it is just over 30 minutes drive from Koforidua and over 90 minutes from Accra depending on your means of transportation.
River Pawnpawn which forms the falls takes it source from Ahenkwa-Amalakpo before falling over an igneous rock outcrop at the Boti Langmase that is how the falls get its name. The fall was hidden in the forest until it was discovered by a white catholic priest. It is recounted by locals that the priest used the base of the falls as an entertainment ground for his friends and himself.

The land on which the falls is located is not without any controversy though. The Akyems of Tafo who were the original owners of the forest/land wanted it back. But it was realized later that the Tafohene had sold that piece of land to one Tetteh Nguo, a Krobo. It took a court settlement to bring the dispute to a closure.
If the dispute brought Boti Falls into the public domain then a visit of the president of Ghana at the time (Dr. Kwame Nkrumah) propelled it into its status as the most attractive and talked about falls in the eastern region of Ghana. The president visited the falls in 1961 and was amazed at the splendor and grandeur of the falls. He therefore tasked the regional commissioner to construct a rest house at the falls.
